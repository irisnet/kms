Key Management System for Cosmos Validators.

https://cosmos.network/

## About

This repository contains `tmkms`, a lightweight service intended to be deployed
alongside the `gaiad` service (ideally on separate physical hosts) which provides
the following:

- **High-availability** access to validator signing keys
- **Double-signing** prevention even in the event the validator process is compromised
- **Hardware security module** storage for validator keys which can survive host compromise

## Status

Tendermint KMS is currently **alpha quality**. It supports YubiHSM2-backed
signing when used in conjunction with `cosmos-sdk` 0.26.

It does NOT yet implement double signing prevention or high availability
features. These are planned features which will be implemented soon.

## Supported Platforms

`tmkms` should build on any [supported Rust platform] which is also supported
by [libusb]. Below are some of the available tier 1, 2, and 3 Rust platforms
which are also supported by **libusb**.

NOTE: `tmkms` is presently tested on Linux/x86_64. We don't otherwise guarantee
support for any of the platforms below, but they theoretically meet the necessary
prerequisites for support.

### Operating Systems

- Linux (recommended)
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD
- macOS

### CPU Architectures

- `x86_64` (recommended)
- `arm` (32-bit ARM)
- `aarch64` (64-bit ARM)
- `mips` (32-bit MIPS)
- `mips64` (64-bit MIPS)
- `powerpc` (32-bit PowerPC)
- `powerpc64` (64-bit PowerPC)
- `sparc64` (64-bit SPARC)

## Installation

You will need the following prerequisites:

- **Rust** (stable; 1.31+): https://rustup.rs/
- **C compiler**: e.g. gcc, clang
- **pkg-config**
- **libusb** (1.0+). Install instructions for common platforms:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev`
  - RedHat/CentOS: `yum install libusb1-devel`
  - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install libusb`

To install `tmkms`, do the following:

1. (x86_64 only) Configure `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable: `export RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes`
2. Run the following to install Tendermint KMS using Rust's `cargo` tool:

```
$ cargo install --features yubihsm,ledgertm --path .
```

3. Copy the example `tmkms.toml` file to a local directory (e.g. `~/.tmkms`):

https://github.com/tendermint/kms/blob/master/tmkms.toml.example

Edit it to match your desired configuration.

## Usage

Start `tmkms` with the following:


```
$ tmkms start
```

This will read the configuration from the `tmkms.toml` file in the current
working directory.

To explicitly specify the path to the configuration, use the `-c` flag:

```
$ tmkms start -c /path/to/tmkms.toml
```

## YubiHSM2 Setup

YubiHSM2 devices from Yubico are the main HSM solution supported by
Tendermint KMS at this time (Ledger support forthcoming!)

The `tmkms yubihsm` subcommand provides YubiHSM2 setup, information, and
testing features:

- `tmkms yubihsm detect` - list all YubiHSM2 devices detected via USB
- `tmkms yubihsm keys` - manage keys on the device
  - `tmkms yubihsm keys generate <id>` - generate an Ed25519 signing key with the given ID number (e.g. 1)
  - `tmkms yubihsm keys list` - list all Ed25519 signing keys in the YubiHSM2
  - `tmkms yubihsm keys test <id>` - perform a signing test using the given key

See also [this walkthrough for setting up a YubiHSM2 with tmkms](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ann-tendermint-kms-v0-0-1-preview-release-with-initial-yubihsm2-support/1218).

### udev configuration

On Linux, you will need to grant `tmkms` access to the YubiHSM2 using
rules for the udev subsystem. Otherwise, you'll get an error like this:

```
$ tmkms yubihsm detect
error: couldn't detect USB devices: USB error: USB(bus=1,addr=4):
       error opening device: Access denied (insufficient permissions)
```

You'll need to create a POSIX group, e.g. `yubihsm` which is allowed to
access the YubiHSM2, and then add the following rules file under the
`/etc/udev/rules.d` directory, e.g. `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-yubihsm.rules`:

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{product}=="YubiHSM", GROUP=="yubihsm"
```

Note that creating this file does not have an immediate effect: you'll
need to reload the udev subsystem, either by rebooting or running the
following command:

```
$ udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
```

For the rules above to apply, make sure you run `tmkms` as a user which is a
member of the `yubihsm` group!

## Development

The following are instructions for setting up a development environment.
They assume you've already followed steps 1 & 2 from the Installation
section above (i.e. installed rustup and the noted nightly Rust released).

- Install **rustfmt**: `rustup component add rustfmt-preview`
- Install **clippy**: `rustup component add clippy-preview`

Alternatively, you can build a Docker image from the [Dockerfile] in the top
level of the repository, which is what is used to run tests in CI.

Before opening a pull request, please run the checks below:

### Testing

Run the test suite with:

```
cargo test --all-features
```

### Format checking (rustfmt)

Make sure your code is well-formatted by running:

```
cargo fmt
```

### Lint (clippy)

Lint your code (i.e. check it for common issues) with:

```
cargo clippy
```
